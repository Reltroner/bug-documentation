# 🛠️ Legal Disclaimer Page – Mobile Responsiveness Fix

## 📄 File Location
`/app/blog/disclaimer/page.jsx`

## 🐞 Bug Summary
The **Legal Disclaimer page** in `reltroner.com` was displaying poorly on mobile screens:

- **Content overflowed or appeared cramped.**
- **No padding or margin applied for smaller viewports.**
- `<img>` element was fixed in width (`width={640}`), causing layout issues on small screens.
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` rendering was not wrapped inside a responsive container with proper typography support.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Layout Changes:
- Wrapped everything in a `div` with responsive padding:
  ```tsx
  <div className="px-4 py-6 sm:px-6 sm:py-8 mx-auto max-w-3xl">
  ```

### Heading Styling:
- Applied responsive font sizes:
  ```tsx
  <Heading className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl mb-4">
  ```

### Image Fix:
- Replaced fixed width with Tailwind classes:
  ```tsx
  className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg mb-6 shadow-md"
  ```

### Article Rendering:
- Used Tailwind `prose` classes for better typography:
  ```tsx
  <article className="prose prose-slate prose-sm sm:prose lg:prose-lg max-w-none">
  ```

## 💡 Notes

This layout fix is **essential for all content pages using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`**, especially when rendering blog posts, declarations, or philosophical pages on mobile screens.

Feel free to reuse this layout pattern as a wrapper component across other content-driven pages in Reltroner Studio.
