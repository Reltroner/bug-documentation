# 🛠️ Case 3 — Composer Install Error (PHP Version Mismatch)

This document describes the issue encountered when running `composer install` with an incompatible PHP version, and how it was identified.

---

## 1. Attempt to Install Dependencies

Inside the Laravel project directory:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
````

---

## 2. Error Encountered

Composer reported that the PHP version was not compatible:

```
Root composer.json requires php ^8.2 but your php version (8.1.33) does not satisfy that requirement.
```

Additional errors indicated multiple packages (Laravel, Symfony, Sanctum, etc.) required **PHP >= 8.2**, while the server default was **PHP 8.1.33**.

---

## 3. Environment Check

Check current PHP version:

```bash
php -v
```

**Result:**

```
PHP 8.1.33 (cli)
```

Check if a newer PHP version is available on the system:

```bash
/opt/cpanel/ea-php83/root/usr/bin/php -v
```

**Result:**

```
PHP 8.3.23 (cli) (built: Jul 10 2025)
```

---

## 4. Analysis

* **Problem:** The server default CLI PHP version was `8.1.33`, which does not meet the Laravel app requirement (`^8.2`).
* **Solution:** Use PHP 8.3 provided by cPanel instead of the default PHP 8.1.

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Identified the mismatch between project requirement (PHP ^8.2) and server default (PHP 8.1.33).
* Confirmed PHP 8.3.23 is available and should be used for Composer and Laravel commands.
