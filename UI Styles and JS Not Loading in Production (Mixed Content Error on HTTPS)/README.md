# [BUG] UI Styles and JS Not Loading in Production (Mixed Content Error on HTTPS)

## Summary

When deploying the Laravel app to production (e.g., Railway) with HTTPS enabled, the UI renders without styles and JavaScript. The browser DevTools show multiple errors for blocked CSS/JS resources due to **mixed content**.

---

## Symptoms

- Page loads without styles or proper JavaScript functionality.
- Browser DevTools shows:
  - `Mixed Content: The page at 'https://app.reltroner.com/dashboard' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure stylesheet/script 'http://app.reltroner.com/...'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.`
- Requests for CSS, JS, images, or even form actions are all blocked if loaded over `http://`.

---

## Root Cause

**Laravel’s `asset()` and `route()` helpers generated asset URLs with `http://` instead of `https://`.**
- This happened because the `.env` variable `APP_URL` was set to `http://app.reltroner.com` (or left as default).
- When the app is served over `https://`, the browser blocks any requests for resources (CSS, JS, images) that use the insecure `http://` protocol (“mixed content”).
- As a result, no styles or scripts are loaded.

---

## Solution

### 1. **Set the `APP_URL` to HTTPS**

Edit your `.env` file in production to:

```env
APP_URL=https://app.reltroner.com
````

### 2. **Use the `asset()`, `secure_asset()`, and `route()` Helpers Properly**

* Never hard-code URLs with `http://` or `https://`.

* Always use Blade helpers:

  ```blade
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('mazer/assets/compiled/css/app.css') }}">
  <img src="{{ asset('images/reltroner-hrm1.png') }}" alt="Logo">
  <form method="POST" action="{{ route('logout') }}">
  ```

* Optionally, to guarantee HTTPS in all environments, use `secure_asset()`:

  ```blade
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ secure_asset('mazer/assets/compiled/css/app.css') }}">
  ```

### 3. **Clear Laravel Cache**

After editing `.env`, run:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### 4. **Redeploy Your App**

Deploy your changes to production and refresh the page.

## Verification

* Open DevTools > Network tab.
* All CSS, JS, and image requests must use `https://`.
* The UI should appear fully styled and interactive.

## Additional Notes

* Mixed content will also block form actions, AJAX requests, and images if using `http://` on an HTTPS site.
* Make sure any CDN or third-party resource uses HTTPS as well.
* Never hard-code protocol in your URLs; always let Laravel generate them based on `APP_URL`!
