# üêõ Laravel + Railway Environment Host Resolution Bug

## üìã Description

When running `php artisan` commands from a **local development environment** such as **Laragon on Windows**, the application throws the following error:

```

SQLSTATE\[HY000] \[2002] php\_network\_getaddresses: getaddrinfo for mysql.railway.internal failed: No such host is known

````

This issue arises because the database host is set to a **private Railway internal address** (`mysql.railway.internal`) which **cannot be resolved from outside Railway's infrastructure**.

---

## üß® Root Cause

- `mysql.railway.internal` is only available within Railway‚Äôs internal network.
- Local environments (Laragon, XAMPP, Homestead, etc.) cannot resolve this host.
- Attempting to connect to it from outside Railway results in a DNS failure.

---

## ‚úÖ Definitive Solutions

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Use Public Railway MySQL Host for Local `.env`

Replace:

```env
DB_HOST=mysql.railway.internal
````

With:

```env
DB_HOST=switchback.proxy.rlwy.net
```

> This public domain is accessible from external machines and should be used in your `.env` when working locally.

---

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Run Commands Inside Railway Terminal

If you want to keep using the internal hostname:

* **Use the Railway Cloud Terminal** instead of local command line:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

> These commands will run **inside Railway**, where `mysql.railway.internal` is resolvable.

## üîÅ Summary: `.env` Configuration Matrix

| Use Case              | DB\_HOST value              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Local development     | `switchback.proxy.rlwy.net` |
| Railway container app | `mysql.railway.internal`    |

---

## üí° Example `.env` for Local Development:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=switchback.proxy.rlwy.net
DB_PORT=24148
DB_DATABASE=railway
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=lPEvTkOpxEAOqvHxEkfYZTWAhXSmcOyB
```

## üí° Example `.env` for Railway Deployment:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql.railway.internal
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=railway
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=lPEvTkOpxEAOqvHxEkfYZTWAhXSmcOyB
```

---

## ‚ú® Tips

To streamline environment management:

* Separate `.env.local` and `.env.production`
* Use `APP_ENV` to auto-select config values
* Automate migrations in deployment using:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force && php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public
```
