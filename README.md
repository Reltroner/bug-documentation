# ⚠️ Error Documentation (by Reltroner)

This repository is a growing collection of error handling logs, solutions, and personal notes on real-world issues encountered in web development (Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap, etc.)

Every file in this repo is a direct battle log. I don't just fix — I document and share.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- Page Not Found on EJS (Express Routing)
- MongoDB query issues
- Bootstrap layout + JS clashes
- Middleware + async bugs

## 🚀 Why This Exists
Because learning from errors is not weakness. It's the foundation of Astralis Pinnacle.
