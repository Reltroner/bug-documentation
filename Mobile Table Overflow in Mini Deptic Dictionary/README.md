# 🛠️ Bugfix Documentation: Mobile Table Overflow in Mini Deptic Dictionary

## Overview

This documentation addresses a UI/UX bug encountered in the React/Next.js page for the **Mini Deptic Dictionary**, specifically when rendered on mobile screens.

---

## ❌ Bug Description

On small screen devices, the top navigation bar (`navbar`) appears **cut off or cropped** when scrolling through the `<table>` content below it. This issue was caused by **unconstrained or improperly styled table widths**, which caused layout shifts and overflow during render.

### 🔍 Symptoms:
- Navbar abruptly cuts off when table section begins.
- Horizontal scrolling appears even when not necessary.
- Table columns overflow their container boundaries.

---

## ✅ Solution

The fix involves enforcing a **fixed table layout** and allowing **word-breaking** inside `<td>` cells. This prevents overflow and keeps table widths constrained inside the layout container.

### Applied Tailwind CSS classes:
```tsx
<table className="w-full table-fixed border text-sm">
````

For each `<td>`:

```tsx
<td className="border px-3 py-2 break-words">
```

For headers, to ensure proportional layout:

```tsx
<th className="border px-3 py-2 text-left w-1/4">Deptic</th>
<th className="border px-3 py-2 text-left w-1/4">Meaning</th>
<th className="border px-3 py-2 text-left w-1/2">Notes</th>
```

## 💡 Why It Works

* `table-fixed`: Forces columns to respect defined widths and prevents layout recalculation.
* `w-full`: Ensures table fills the parent container.
* `break-words`: Allows long content to wrap, avoiding overflow.
* Explicit column widths (`w-1/4`, `w-1/2`): Distributes the space evenly and consistently.
